This work is based on [Robust Tracking against Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09919.pdf) in ECCV2020. [[Project]](https://github.com/VISION-SJTU/RTAA)

## Introduction
<img src="https://github.com/joshuajss/rtaaplus/blob/main/img/pipeline.png" width='700'/><br/>

Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. 
- We study the robustness of the state-of-the-art deep trackers against adversarial attacks under both white-box and black-box settings. 
- We propose a defense method to subtract perturbations from the input frame, which eliminates performance drops caused by adversarial attacks. 
- We craft universal adversarial perturbations to directly inject them into every frame of video sequences, leading to a higher attack speed.
- We choose four representative trackers, [SiamRPN++](https://github.com/STVIR/pysot), [SiamCAR](https://github.com/ohhhyeahhh/SiamCAR), [RT-MDNet](https://github.com/IlchaeJung/RT-MDNet) and [TransT](https://github.com/chenxin-dlut/TransT).

## Quick Start

:herb: **The code of adversarial attack and defense on SiamRPN++ is released.**

- Please follow [SiamRPN++](https://github.com/STVIR/pysot) to finish the experimental setting, including dataset, model, environment, etc.
- First, put ```test_attack.py``` and ```test_defense.py``` into ```tools``` folder.
- Second, replace the original ```siamrpn_tracker.py``` in ```pysot/tracker``` with our new ```siamrpn_tracker.py```.
- Note that the new ```siamrpn_tracker.py``` in this project consists of all original codes of SiamRPN++ and our new attack and defense code.


Test the original performance on OTB100 dataset, please using the follwing command.
```bash
cd experiments/siamrpn_r50_l234_dwxcorr_otb
python -u ../../tools/test.py 	\
	--snapshot model.pth 	\ # model path
	--dataset OTB100 	\ # dataset name
	--config config.yaml	  # config file
```

Test the adversarial attack performance on OTB100 dataset, please using the follwing command.
```bash
cd experiments/siamrpn_r50_l234_dwxcorr_otb
python -u ../../tools/test_attack.py 	\
	--snapshot model.pth     	\ # model path
	--dataset OTB100         	\ # dataset name
	--config config.yaml	          # config file
```


Test the adversarial defense performance on OTB100 dataset, please using the follwing command.
```bash
cd experiments/siamrpn_r50_l234_dwxcorr_otb
python -u ../../tools/test_defense.py 	\
	--snapshot model.pth     	\ # model path
	--dataset OTB100         	\ # dataset name
	--config config.yaml	          # config file
```

- The original/attack/defense results will be saved in the current directory(results/dataset/model_name/).
- ```--vis``` can be used to visualize the tracking results during attack and defense.
